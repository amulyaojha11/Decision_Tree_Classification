# Decision Tree Classification
Decision Trees are a type of Supervised Machine Learning (that is you explain what the input is and what the corresponding output is in the training data) where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter.
The tree can be explained by two entities, namely decision nodes and leaves.
The leaves are the decisions or the final outcomes.
And the decision nodes are where the data is split.

## Decision Tree Models
Decision tree is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning.
Decision trees are constructed via an algorithmic approach that identifies ways to split a data set based on different conditions. 
It is one of the most widely used and practical methods for supervised learning.
Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for both classification and regression tasks.
